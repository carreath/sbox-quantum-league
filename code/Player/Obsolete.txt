These files were copied for convenience


Original Message:

Files in this folder shouldn't really be in the base addon.


# Facepunch
	
	We shouldn't create more reliance on the files being here. We should be able to delete
	them without too much trouble in the future.


# Developers

	I would encourage game creators to reduce their reliance on these files. Maybe copy and paste
	them into your own game and use them from there. This will be better in the long run because
	we won't be able to break your code by changing/deleting/moving them.


# Plan

	1. Put them in an Obsolete folder
	2. Create game addon templates that provide own version of them
	3. Put them in a different namespace (Sandbox.Obsolete)
	4. Mark them as [Obsolete]
	5. Remove them completely
